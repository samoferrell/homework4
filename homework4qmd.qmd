## Task 1: Conceptual Questions
1. What is the purpose of the lapply() function? What is the equivalent purrr function?
> The purpose of the lapply() function is to apply a function to each element in a list. The equivalent purrr function is the map() function

2. Suppose we have a list called my_list. Each element of the list is a numeric data frame (all columns
are numeric). We want use lapply() to run the code cor(numeric_matrix, method = "kendall")
on each element of the list. Write code to do this below! (Iâ€™m really trying to ask you how you specify
method = "kendall" when calling lapply())
> lapply(numeric_namtrix = my_list, method = "kendall")

3. What are two advantages of using purrr functions instead of the BaseR apply family?
> The purrr functions have common function names and syntax across functions. 

4. What is a side-effect function?
> A side-effect function is a function that doesn't change anything it just creates output.

5. Why can you name a variable sd in a function and not cause any issues with the sd function?
> local/global properties of objects.


## Task 2: Writing R Functions
```{r}
getRMSE <- function(responses, predictions){
  n <- length(responses)
  RMSE <- sqrt((1/n)*sum((responses - predictions)^2)
    
  )
}
```
